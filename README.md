# Image Classification Playground

Image Classification Playground is a platform for Training and Labeling Images, and Retraining Image Classification Models. The trained models classify images based on the [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification). The system offers a simple and User-Friendly Interface to a beginner to play around with the Image Classification Model. The labels of the predicted images, if wrongly predicted, can be changed by the user such that the default model can be retrained using the correct labels for the provided images. The user has the ability to modify the existing layers in the default model's neural network and build a completely different model with customizable parameters and view the model accuracy and loss in the model training process.

### Note
